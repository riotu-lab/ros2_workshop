### Cloning the Repository

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the course packages on your local machine:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src` directory of your ROS2 workspace:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   ```

2. Clone this Git repository into the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riotu-lab/ros2_course_packages.git
   ```

### Configuring the Workspace

After cloning the repository, you need to configure your workspace:

1. Move the content of the `ros2_course_packages` folder to the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/
   mv src/ros2_course_packages/* src/
   ```

2. Remove the now empty `ros2_course_packages` folder:

   ```bash
   rm -r src/ros2_course_packages
   ```

Your ROS2 workspace is now configured with the course packages.

### Building and Running the Packages

With the packages set up in your ROS2 workspace, you can now build and run them. Refer to the specific package documentation for instructions on how to build and execute the provided examples.

Remember to source your ROS2 workspace before running any examples:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

## Running Examples

To run the examples provided in each package, follow the steps below:

1. Build the packages by navigating to the root of your ROS2 workspace and running the `colcon build` command:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build
   ```

2. Source the installed packages to make them available for use:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

3. Execute any example provided in the packages using the `ros2 run` command. For instance, to run the `talker` node from the `ros2_essential_cpp` package, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 run ros2_essential_cpp talker
   ```

Refer to each package's documentation for specific instructions on how to run its examples.
